description: many2many conversion of SQL <-> PHP (associative) arrays and tree's
note: |
  class which makes life easier when it comes to storing/retrieving hierarchical 
  arrays (trees) from the database. When you use this, you will be saved from 
  lots of recursive mayhem ;]
  
  the idea is to do two-way conversion of trees and indented lists easily.
  Why? So you can easily store the structure in the database, and easily render
  this structure into a html selectionbox/menus etc. Think of it as some kind of 
  'serialize/unserialize' function, but with having the search-benefits of SQL.
  I hope you have fun slappin those trees :]

  For explanation how to use see /lib/core/treeManager/class.treeManager.php
