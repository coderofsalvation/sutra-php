description: session class which manages/creates (ajax)  sessions or timeouts
note: |
  Usage:
  
  please put a variable 'var SESSION_ID = <? echo session_id(); ?>' in javascript,
  and pass it with every ajax-request.
  Then this php class will restore the session, and you will not have to deal with
  mysterious empty $_SESSION arrays during ajaxcalls.
