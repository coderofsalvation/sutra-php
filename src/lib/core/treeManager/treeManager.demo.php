What is it?
===========
              Something I got tired of doing over and over again.
              This class which makes life easier when it comes to storing/retrieving hierarchical 
              arrays (trees) from/to the database. When you use this, you will be saved from 
              lots of recursive mayhem ;]

              the idea is to do two-way conversion of tree's and indented lists easily.
              Why? So you can easily store the structure in the database, and easily render
              this structure into a html selectionbox/menus etc. Think of it as some kind of 
              'serialize/unserialize' function, but with having the search-benefits of SQL.
              I hope you have fun slappin those trees :]

Usage example
=============
              Suppose your sql table layout is :

              [ id(int11) | parent_id(int11) | weight(int11) | title_menu | content(text ]

                  $treeManager     = treeManager::get();
                  $records         = $db->getArrayFromSql( "SELECT * FROM mytable" );
                  // here we have our multidimensional, weightsorted tree!
                  $recordsTree     = $treeManager->getTree( 'id', 'parent_id', 'weight', $records );
                  // here we have this tree slapped into a one-dimensional indented list
                  $recordsSlapped  = $treeManager->slapTree( $records );
                  // and vice versa!
                  $recordsTree     = $treeManager->getTree( 'id', 'parent_id', 'weight', $recordsSlapped );
                  // or wait, lets view our tree in text/html!
                  foreach( $recordsSlapped as $node )
                    echo "{$node['title_menu_indent']}\n";

Live Example
============

              suppose this is our datastructure (from SQL/PHP) :

              $records      = array(  0 => array(  "id"        => 23,
                                                   "parent_id" => 0,
                                                   "title_menu" => "root A",
                                                   "weight"    => 1 ),
                                      5 => array(  "id"        => 24,
                                                   "parent_id" => 23,
                                                   "title_menu" => "child 2",
                                                   "weight"    => 3 ),
                                      2 => array(  "id"        => 25,
                                                   "parent_id" => 0,
                                                   "title_menu" => "root B",
                                                   "weight"    => 1 ),
                                      3 => array(  "id"        => 26,
