  library functions to serve a simple 'lite' content managable site
  NOTE: do not try to go beyond this functionality...better switch to the cms package.
 
  the site functions as followed:
    - the content is located in /data/content.yaml.php
    - normally the "home" page is loaded
    - else the first url argument will be taken as key index (like 'www.yoursite.com/home' = 'home' )

dependency:
  lib:
    - yaml:1.0
    - tpl:1.0
    - nicedit:1.0
