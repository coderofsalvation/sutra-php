note: |
  Be sure to put 'error' in the 'autocreate' section in /data/cfg.yaml.php
  After that you are ok, and can use in PHP:

  _assert( false, "something went wrong!" ); // if configured, this will be emailed

  in JAVASCRIPT:

  print_r( document.location );
  assert( is.Function( alert ), "this should not fail!" ); // if configures, this will be emailed
